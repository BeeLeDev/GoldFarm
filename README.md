Gold farming code using wizAPI by Jake Belanger:
https://github.com/Jacob124/wizAPI

I fixed some of the issues I had locally on my system with the wizAPI, you can feel free to use my updated version of the wizAPI and see if it runs properly on your system compared to the original. TRY BOTH TO SEE WHICH RUNS CORRECTLY.

This code (gold.py) is not optimized to work 100% of the time, there are pieces in the code that I wanted to use such as the "is_GH_loading" which is exactly like "is_DS_loading" but for Wintertusk, that don't work the way it was intended, so I had to substitute it with timers to wait for a certain duration instead. There are lots of errors I faced where the player would just be standing there doing nothing when it had worked consinstently for a while, then proceeded to just give up. MAKE SURE TO CHECK THE BOT EVERY 10 MINUTES IN CASE.

If there are bugs please do let me know.
