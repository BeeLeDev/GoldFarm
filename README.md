Gold farming code using wizAPI by Jake Belanger:
https://github.com/Jacob124/wizAPI

**- DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE SPELLS THAT YOU WANT TO USE IN LINE 63 AND 64**\
**- ADD THE .PNG OF THE CARD BASE AND ITS ENCHANTED**

This code was made for the dungeon at Wintertusk - Vestrilund farming Halfang Bristlecrown.

I fixed some of the issues I had locally on my system with the wizAPI, you can feel free to use my updated version of the wizAPI and see if it runs properly on your system compared to the original. **TRY BOTH TO SEE WHICH RUNS CORRECTLY.**

There are lots of errors I faced where the player would keep running into a wall permanently after the battle is over when it had worked consinstently for a while. **MAKE SURE TO CHECK THE BOT EVERY 10 MINUTES IN CASE.**

If there are bugs please do let me know.
